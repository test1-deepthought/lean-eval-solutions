Koszul formula

- Problem ID: `koszul_formula`
- Test Problem: no
- Submitter: Kim Morrison
- Notes: §38 of Knill's 'Some Fundamental Theorems in Mathematics' (additional statement of the Riemannian-geometry section; the boxed main theorem is Levi-Civita). The Koszul formula: 2⟨∇_X Y, Z⟩ equals the cyclic sum of directional derivatives X·⟨Y,Z⟩ + Y·⟨X,Z⟩ − Z·⟨X,Y⟩ minus the Lie-bracket cyclic sum ⟨X,[Y,Z]⟩ + ⟨Y,[X,Z]⟩ − ⟨Z,[X,Y]⟩. The identity that forces uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection. Mathlib has the covariant-derivative / Riemannian-bundle / Lie-bracket machinery but no metric-compatibility predicate and no Koszul formula. The Challenge ships one helper (IsMetricCompatible).

- Informal solution: Direct algebraic manipulation from metric compatibility and torsion-freeness. Metric compatibility gives X·g(Y,Z) = g(∇_X Y, Z) + g(Y, ∇_X Z), and cyclic permutations Y·g(Z,X) and Z·g(X,Y). Torsion-freeness gives ∇_X Y − ∇_Y X = [X,Y] (and permutations). Form the linear combination X·g(Y,Z) + Y·g(X,Z) − Z·g(X,Y); expand each term via metric compatibility; substitute the torsion-free identities to convert ∇_X Z − ∇_Z X, ∇_Y Z − ∇_Z Y, and ∇_X Y − ∇_Y X into Lie brackets. The cross-terms ±g(∇_Y X, Z), ±g(∇_X Z, Y), ±g(∇_Y Z, X) collapse pairwise except for 2·g(∇_X Y, Z), yielding the formula.

Do not modify `Challenge.lean` or `Solution.lean`. Those files are part of the
trusted benchmark and fixed by the repository.

Write your solution in `Submission.lean` and any additional local modules under
`Submission/`.

Participants may use Mathlib freely. Any helper code not already available in
Mathlib must be inlined into the submission workspace.

Multi-file submissions are allowed through `Submission.lean` and additional local
modules under `Submission/`.

`lake test` runs comparator for this problem. The command expects a comparator
binary in `PATH`, or in the `COMPARATOR_BIN` environment variable.
