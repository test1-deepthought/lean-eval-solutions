# Isoperimetric inequality (`n`-dimensional, topological-frontier form)

For any measurable bounded `B ⊆ ℝⁿ` with `n ≥ 2`,

  `n^n · volume(B)^{n−1} · volume(closedBall 0 1) ≤ μHE[n−1](frontier B)^n`,

where `μHE[n−1]` is the `(n−1)`-dimensional Euclidean Hausdorff measure
on the topological frontier. For a smooth bounded domain with regular
bounding hypersurface `S = frontier B`, `μHE[n−1] (frontier B)` agrees
with the classical surface area, so the statement specialises to the
smooth form Knill writes in §63 of *Some Fundamental Theorems in
Mathematics*.

This is the topological-frontier formulation, not the canonical De
Giorgi finite-perimeter form. The topological frontier of a measurable
set can strictly contain its reduced boundary, so this is a strictly
weaker inequality than the perimeter-level statement, but valid for
any measurable bounded set.

The `n = 1` case is excluded because the `ENNReal` formulation fails
for `B = ∅`: `0^0 · vol(B₁) = 2` while `μHE[0](∅) = 0`.
